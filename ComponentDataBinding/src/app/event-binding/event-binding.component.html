<!-- Event Binding
1.A click, hover, or a keyboard action are all events that 
you can use to call component logic within Angular.
2.It's one-way data binding, in that it sends 
information from the view to the component class.
3. This is opposite from property binding, where 
data is sent from the component class to the view.
4.we capture any event from view by wrapping the event 
with () parenthesis.
5.Angular provides you with a varity of events from
which you can all component logic. -->
